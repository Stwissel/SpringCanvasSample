# Salesforce Canvas and Spring Boot

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

## The challenge
Salesforce canvas offers a capable integration point between Salesforce and external applications to surface them inside the Salesforce UI. One of the aspects is establishing identiy. There are two options: OAuth and a signed request. I'm looking at the later. A signed request posts (as in HTTP POST) a digitally signed JSON request to the external application.
